<p>The final project is an open-ended assignment. You're free to explore any topic
that interests you, as long as it is relevant to CSC110 and you can produce a
working program to demo at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>This assignment counts as two normal assignments for the purpose of final
grades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting the program and other required material on time counts as one
completed assignment</li>
<li>Participating in the in-class demos and discussing your program with me counts
as one completed assignment</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups"><a class="header" href="#groups">Groups</a></h2>
<p>You can complete this project on your own or work in a group. Groups must be
established in your proposal, and all group members must be present when making
the proposal.</p>
<h2 id="proposal"><a class="header" href="#proposal">Proposal</a></h2>
<p>Before you begin the project, you must present the idea for your project during
class or during my in-person office hours. I will reserve some time at the end
of class meetings for these proposals.</p>
<p>A proposal should take no more than five minutes to present and must answer the
questions below. You can format this information however you want as long as it
can be displayed with your laptop.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is working on the project?</li>
<li>What will your program do when the project is complete?</li>
<li>What do you expect to learn from creating this program? Different group
members may have different learning goals depending on how the work is
divided.</li>
<li>If working in a group, what is the primary responsibility of each group
member? Everyone must contribute substantially to the code written for a
group project. I expect group projects to be large enough that each member
can "own" a specific part of the program, even if other portions are a shared
responsibility.</li>
<li>What are some concrete objectives that can be used to assess whether you have
completed the project? These are the criteria I will use to grade the
submitted program.</li>
</ol>
<p>I may ask for changes before approving your project. When assessing a proposal,
I will consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you address everything listed above?</li>
<li>Are your objectives clear enough that I can use them to assess your finished
program?</li>
<li>Does the project have a clear and reasonable scope? Projects that are too
ambitious to complete in a few weeks or so small as to be trivial aren't
suitable for this assignment. Let's assume you will work on this for three
weeks and spend 2-5 hours per week. That means it should involve somewhere
from 5 to 15 hours of work per group member to complete. This does not include
unproductive time, like spending two hours debugging a small problem that
would have taken a few minutes if you had asked for help. If you spend time
poorly, then expect to spend significantly more than the estimated 5-15 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final projects will not be accepted without an approved proposal. If, while
working on the project, you wish to make significant changes from what was
covered in your proposal, then you must present an updated proposal for the new
version by the proposal deadline. If you don't do this, or if I don't approve
the new version, then you will be held to the version that I did approve.</p>
<p>All material used for your presentation must be uploaded to Blackboard before
you present it. If we don't have enough time for everyone who wishes to present
on a given day, then I will prioritize groups based on how early their material
was uploaded to Blackboard.</p>
<p>Finally, a reminder not to use an LLM or other AI tool to write your proposal or
generate material for a proposal. I want to hear <em>you</em> explain <em>your idea</em> for
<em>your project</em>. Unauthorized AI use or plagiarism on the proposal will be
treated just as seriously as if you had cheated on the program.</p>
<h2 id="demo-1-point"><a class="header" href="#demo-1-point">Demo (1 Point)</a></h2>
<p>At the end of the semester, either during the last week of class or during our
final exam period, we will demo final projects. This will be an informal
process: each group who completed a project should have their program ready to
run on a laptop, and all students will be free to wander around and check out
other project demos. Be prepared to explain your program, show how it works,
and, if you're comfortable doing so, allow other people to try using it.</p>
<p>I will look at every project during this time and ask each group to demonstrate
their finished program. Presenting your work on this day is worth 1 completed
assignment. To receive credit, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be present for this class meeting.</li>
<li>Have a working program that matches what you described in your proposal.</li>
<li>Help demonstrate your program to me and answer questions about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you cannot attend the demo and want to schedule a make-up, then I expect you
to notify me as early as possible and explain why you cannot attend. I will only
allow make-ups if notified promptly and if the absence was necessary (not, for
example, because you decided to go on a vacation that day or wanted to leave
early for winter break).</p>
<h2 id="program-submission-1-point"><a class="header" href="#program-submission-1-point">Program Submission (1 Point)</a></h2>
<p>Your finished program must be submitted on Blackboard before the deadline. This
submission on its own is worth 1 completed assignment, provided the following
requirements are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>The program is submitted on time.</li>
<li>The program compiles, runs, and is what you described in your proposal. It
must meet your stated objectives or be reasonably close to meeting each
objective.</li>
<li>Your program should be runnable with the <code>java</code> command on your main source
file. If it requires additional steps to compile/run, then include
compile/run instructions with your submission.</li>
<li>Your program should provide clear prompts and directions for the user. If a
user would need to know something that the program doesn't explain to them,
then include instructions for using the program with your submission. The
user should not have to read your code to understand how to use the program.</li>
<li>If your program has significant bugs or there was a problem meeting some of
your objectives, then you must include an explanation of these issues with
the submission. I expect to see a good faith effort towards completing each
objective, and the program must be close to meeting each objective even if
you ran into issues.</li>
<li>If you worked in a group, then your submission must include a summary of each
member's contributions to the project. These must be consistent with the
individual responsibilities given in your proposal.</li>
</ol>
