<p>This site includes all assignments for our class. Deadlines can be found on
Blackboard and on the course schedule. Most assignments are autograded, and
these are subject to the rules in the <a href="./autograded.html">autograded assignments</a>
section. The autograded assignments are also grouped into two projects, and each
assignment in the series builds towards a larger program. You should complete
them in order so that you can reuse material from earlier assignments in the
series.</p>
<p>Finally, a reminder that you are responsible for knowing the relevant policies
in our syllabus and how they apply to these assignments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../syllabus/grading">Grading</a></li>

<h1 id="autograded-assignments"><a class="header" href="#autograded-assignments">Autograded Assignments</a></h1>
<h2 id="testing"><a class="header" href="#testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p>Autograded assignments are subject to the submission limits given in the
deadline policy and will be checked by several programs I wrote to test student
code. These tests will run your program or its functions with different inputs
and check whether it produces the correct results.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-accountability"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-and-accountability">Academic Integrity and Accountability</a></h3>
<p>Attempting to deliberately fool the test programs, hide malicious code in your
source file, or otherwise intentionally sabotage tests is not allowed and will
be treated as an AIA violation.</p>
<h3 id="test-criteria"><a class="header" href="#test-criteria">Test Criteria</a></h3>
<p>Tests will normally check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Output produced by <code>IO.println</code> and <code>IO.print</code>. Your program's output must
match any requirements given in the assignment. Any difference (wrong
spelling, capitalization, etc.) will fail an I/O test.</li>
<li>Values returned by your function. If your function returns a value, then the
value must match any requirements given in the assignment.</li>
<li>Modifications to array arguments passed to your function. If your function
takes any array parameters, then it must modify them as described in the
assignment's requirements. Any extra modifications will usually cause a test
to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tests will always ignore any output produced by <code>IO.readln</code>. I never specify how
exactly to prompt the user for input, so you may word these prompts however you
want. The tests will only look at output from <code>IO.print</code> and <code>IO.println</code>. This
also means you shouldn't use <code>IO.readln</code> to print any of the required output.</p>
<p>A few other ways for a test to fail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompting for additional input or prompting in the wrong order. The test
provides input in the order described in the assignment, so your code needs to
read it in the same order.</li>
<li>Printing output in the wrong order, combining separate lines into the same
line, or splitting up one line into several lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="random-numbers"><a class="header" href="#random-numbers">Random Numbers</a></h3>
<p>If your program needs to generate random numbers, then it must use
<code>Math.random()</code> to generate the number and scale, adjust, and round this value
as needed. For example, <code>(int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1</code> generates a random
integer from 1 to 6.</p>
<p>Your program must also avoid generating unnecessary random numbers. The tests
will seed the random number generator to ensure your code receives the same
sequence of "random" values that were used when generating the expected output,
and generating extra random numbers in your code will change this sequence and
cause you to fail tests.</p>
<h2 id="test-feedback"><a class="header" href="#test-feedback">Test Feedback</a></h2>
<p>My test program will generate markdown, html, and pdf files with the results of
any failed tests. This feedback will provide some information about the failed
test to help you find and fix any mistakes in your program.</p>
<h2 id="code-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#code-restrictions">Code Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>To ensure your code is compatible with my tests, there are a few restrictions
you need to follow. Ignoring any of these restrictions will usually cause your
submission to fail all tests (or be marked invalid before even reaching the
tests), and in some cases it will flag your code for review as potentially
plagiarized or AI-generated.</p>
<p>These restrictions aren't a problem if you are writing your code as shown in
class and only write code that you understand. If you don't know what something
means and we haven't covered it in class (like a <code>static</code> modifier), then
there's no reason you'd write it into your program.</p>
<h3 id="compact-source"><a class="header" href="#compact-source">Compact Source</a></h3>
<p>You program must be a compact source file, and your <code>main</code> function must be
declared as <code>void main()</code>. You must not use <code>static</code> or any other modifiers with
your functions and variables.</p>
<h3 id="io-functions"><a class="header" href="#io-functions">I/O Functions</a></h3>
<p>Any I/O must use the <code>IO</code> functions we learned in class: <code>IO.readln</code>,
<code>IO.print</code>, and <code>IO.println</code>. No <code>System.out</code>, <code>Console</code>, or <code>Scanner</code>.</p>
<h3 id="standard-library"><a class="header" href="#standard-library">Standard Library</a></h3>
<p>The Java standard library is a useful tool, and you should learn how to use it.
However, these projects are meant to be completed with the limited tools we
cover in class, and the standard library can trivialize some problems that
you're meant to solve by hand. You're free to make use of any <code>String</code> methods,
any of the <code>IO</code> and <code>Math</code> functions we've covered, and parsing functions (like
<code>Integer.parseInt</code>). However, using other parts of the standard library that we
haven't covered, such as <code>System</code> or <code>Scanner</code>, is not allowed. You're also not
allowed to use any third-party libraries in autograded assignments.</p>
<h3 id="java-keywordsfeatures"><a class="header" href="#java-keywordsfeatures">Java Keywords/Features</a></h3>
<p>Your code should not declare classes, use try-catch, or otherwise rely on
advanced features of the language that we haven't covered in class. The tools
you have are more than adequate to solve these problems, and they allow for a
variety of solutions to most of the programs.</p>
<h1 id="character-sheet-project"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet-project">Character Sheet Project</a></h1>
<p>This is some background information for the next four assignments. If you're not
interested in the background and just want to write the programs, then feel free
to skip this! You can code those programs without knowing anything about TTRPGs.</p>
<h2 id="dungeons-and-dragons"><a class="header" href="#dungeons-and-dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop roleplaying game</a>
(TTRPG). Even if you haven't played a TTRPG before, you've probably still heard
the name "Dungeons and Dragons" at some point. These assignments will use a
modified version of some character creation rules from D&amp;D 5e. The real rules
can be found in the <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/">5e System Reference Document</a>
(SRD), which you can read if you're curious and want to learn more. However, you
do not need to read the SRD for this assignment.</p>
<h2 id="character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet">Character Sheet</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind these assignments is to write a program that generates a
"character sheet" for someone playing a TTRPG like D&amp;D. A player normally
controls a fictional character (their Player Character, or PC), and they track
information about their character on a character sheet. This might include
statistics, like how strong or fast the character is, the character's
possessions, or information about the character's personality.</p>
<p>The character sheet you generate will not cover all of the information about a
real TTRPG character. This would get too complicated for an early programming
assignment. Instead, we'll use a small subset of rules from the SRD, some of
which will be simplified to better fit this assignment. You don't need to know
any of these rules! The assignments will explain any calculations your code
needs to perform.</p>
<h2 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>Below is a summary of some terms that will come up in this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character's <strong>class</strong> is the role they fill in the game's world. In a game
like D&amp;D, which focuses on fighting fantasy monsters, a character's class
tells us their role in combat. A wizard casts spells, a rogue sneaks up on
enemies, and a fighter... fights. Yes, everyone fights, but the fighter fights
more directly, like with a sword and shield.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ancestry</strong> or <strong>race</strong> (the term varies by game, but I'll
usually default to ancestry) represents what kind of creature they are. D&amp;D
includes a lot of your standard fantasy races: elf, human, dwarf, goblin,
gnome, halfling, and orc. However, depending on the game and who's running it,
a TTRPG character could be anything: a ghost, a dragon, a talking bear, or a
mannequin. I have run a game of D&amp;D that included both a talking bear and a
mannequin as player characters. The mannequin also talked, and his name was
Bob. The bear had a pet monkey. All of this will be on the exam<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#exam">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>hit points</strong> (HP) represent how difficult they are to defeat
in combat.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>armor class</strong> (AC) represents how hard they are to hit with an
attack. A high AC may mean that a character is very good at avoiding attacks,
or that a character is wearing armor that blocks most attacks.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability scores</strong> are numbers that represent a character's
strength, cunning, speed, and other innate qualities. These affect most
actions in the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability modifiers</strong> are bonuses or penalties derived from
their ability scores. The modifiers are the numbers we actually use in most
calculations, and the scores only exist to determine the modifiers. At this
point, you may be wondering why we bother with ability scores if we don't use
them after calculating the modifiers. Good question! Anyway, let's talk about
the character's level.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>level</strong> represents how powerful and experienced they are. In
most TTRPGs, characters gain experience and level up to represent how they've
grown during their adventures.</li>
<li>In addition to standard six-sided dice (referred to as D6 dice), D&amp;D uses
several less common dice shapes: D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20.</li>
</ul>

<p>We don't have exams, don't worry.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="assignment-1"><a class="header" href="#assignment-1">Assignment 1</a></h1>
<p>In this assignment you will write a program that prompts the user for
information and prints this information to the terminal. You'll also perform a
few operations to show that the information was parsed as the correct type.</p>
<h2 id="autograded"><a class="header" href="#autograded">Autograded</a></h2>
<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<h2 id="directions"><a class="header" href="#directions">Directions</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet1.java</code>.</li>
<li>Prompt the user for the following information (in order):
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's class (String)</li>
<li>The character's ancestry (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's strength score (int)</li>
<li>The character's dexterity score (int)</li>
<li>The character's constitution score (int)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print each of these values back in the same order (player name, character
name, etc.). Each value should be printed on a separate line. Print only the
value, no label!</li>
<li>Print the sum of the level, strength score, dexterity score, and constitution
score.</li>
</ol>
<p>One problem you might run into with this program is that "class" is a Java
keyword. It would be natural to use class as the name for the variable that
holds the character's class, but Java won't allow keywords as identifiers. The
name "clazz" is sometimes used as a workaround, but any other name that still
conveys the purpose of the variable is fine.</p>

<p>The directions cover all requirements for this assignment. This section will
normally explain additional details not included with the directions.</p>
<h1 id="assignment-2"><a class="header" href="#assignment-2">Assignment 2</a></h1>
<p>In this assignment you will add some formatting to your output and perform some
calculations that would be used in a real 5e character sheet according to the
SRD (see <a href="./character_sheet.html">background</a> page for more information).</p>
<h2 id="autograded-1"><a class="header" href="#autograded-1">Autograded</a></h2>
<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<h2 id="directions-1"><a class="header" href="#directions-1">Directions</a></h2>
<p>These directions will use arrow brackets (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>) to mark placeholder
values in the output. Your code should print the relevant value instead of the
arrow brackets and whatever text is between them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet2.java</code>.</li>
<li>Prompt for the same input as the previous assignment.</li>
<li>Calculate the character's <strong>proficiency bonus</strong> using the formula in the
requirements section.</li>
<li>For each <strong>ability score</strong> (strength, dexterity, constitution), calculate a
corresponding <strong>ability modifier</strong> using the formula in the requirements
section.</li>
<li>Print the player's name formatted as <code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code>. For example, if the
player's name is "Bob" then your code would print "Player: Bob".</li>
<li>Print the character's name, level, ancestry, and class formatted as
<code>&lt;NAME&gt;, Level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code>. For example, if the character's
name was "Elrond", their level was 20, their ancestry was "Elf", and their
class was "Cleric", then your code would print "Elrond, Level 20 Elf Cleric".</li>
<li>Print the proficiency bonus in the format <code>Proficiency: &lt;PROFICIENCY&gt;</code>. For
example, if the character's level is 7, then their proficiency bonus is 3
(using the aforementioned formula) and your code will print "Proficiency: 3".</li>
<li>Print each ability name ("Strength", "Dexterity", "Constitution"), score, and
modifier in the following format: <code>&lt;NAME&gt;: &lt;SCORE&gt;, &lt;MODIFIER&gt;</code>. For example,
if the character's strength score is 15, then their modifier is 2 (using the
aforementioned formula) and your code will print "Strength: 15, 2". Each
ability must be printed on a separate line.</li>

in the order strength, dexterity, constitution.</li>
<li>Use the following formulas for your calculations:
<ul>
<li>proficiency bonus: <code>(level + 3) / 4 + 1</code></li>
<li>ability modifier: <code>score / 2 - 5</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: ability scores and ability modifiers are two separate numbers. You get the
score from user input, and you calculate the modifier using a formula. The score
remains the same after this calculation. "Modifier" is just the term used for
this number; it doesn't actual change the score.</p>
<h2 id="output-sample"><a class="header" href="#output-sample">Output Sample</a></h2>
<p>Here's an example of what the full output should look like when the program is
finished:</p>
<pre><code>Player: Bob
Elrond, Level 20 Elf Cleric
Proficiency: 6
Strength: 8, -1
Dexterity: 15, 2
Constitution: 12, 1
</code></pre>
<h1 id="assignment-3"><a class="header" href="#assignment-3">Assignment 3</a></h1>
<p>In this assignment you will implement a point buy system for selecting the
user's ability scores and calculate some more stats for the character. The point
buy rules will be similar to but simpler than the rules given in the SRD.</p>

<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<h2 id="directions-2"><a class="header" href="#directions-2">Directions</a></h2>
<p>The requirements section will show the exact wording required for any
warning/error messages printed by your code and the formulas required for any
calculations. Anything not specified in this assignment should remain as it was
in the previous assignment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet3.java</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy your work from the previous assignment into your file. This assignment
assumes you are starting from a working version of that program that passes
all of its tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user inputs their class, check whether they chose one of the
following options: "Fighter", "Rogue", or "Barbarian". If they chose a
different class, then print a warning message to let them know their class
isn't supported by our program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user inputs their ancestry, check whether they chose one of the
following options: "Orc", "Elf", or "Gnome". If they chose a different
ancestry, then print a warning message to let them know their ancestry isn't
supported by our program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you prompt the user for their ability scores, check whether those
scores sum to more than 36. If they sum to more than 36, then print an error
message and prompt the user for new ability scores. Repeat this process until
the user enters a set of scores that sum to 36 or less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user enters a set of valid ability scores and <strong>before</strong> you
calculate ability modifiers, make the following adjustment based on the
character's ancestry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orc: increase their strength score by 2</li>
<li>Elf: increase their dexterity score by 2</li>
<li>Gnome: increase their constitution score by 2</li>
<li>Other (they chose an unsupported ancestry): don't change any scores</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: it's okay if this raises the total above 36! We're only enforcing that
rule for the unadjusted scores we get from the user in the previous step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the "hit die" depending on the character's class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighter: 10</li>
<li>Rogue: 8</li>
<li>Barbarian: 12</li>
<li>Other (they chose an unsupported class): 6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the character's proficiency bonus, ability modifiers, hit points,
armor class, and attack using the formulas given in the requirements. Those
last three depend on the ability modifiers and proficiency, so calculate them
last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When printing the character sheet, add the following three lines before the
proficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Hit Points(D&lt;HIT DIE&gt;): &lt;HIT POINTS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Armor Class: &lt;ARMOR CLASS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attack: &lt;ATTACK&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2 id="requirements-2"><a class="header" href="#requirements-2">Requirements</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Prompt for input in the same order as the previous assignment, but with the
added loop to enforce the maxmimum ability score total described in the
directions.</li>
<li>Print the following warning/error messages where appropriate, using the
erroneous input instead of the placeholder value. The quotes must still appear
in your output.
<ul>
<li><code>WARNING: The class "&lt;CLASS&gt;" is not supported by this program.</code></li>
<li><code>WARNING: The ancestry "&lt;ANCESTRY&gt;" is not supported by this program.</code></li>
<li><code>ERROR: Ability scores must sum to 36 or less! Try again.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the following formulas for your calculations:
<ul>
<li>proficiency bonus: <code>(level + 3) / 4 + 1</code></li>
<li>ability modifier: <code>score / 2 - 5</code></li>
<li>hit points: <code>level * (hit die + constitution modifier)</code></li>
<li>armor class: <code>10 + proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier</code></li>
<li>attack: <code>proficiency bonus + strength modifier</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may assume the user always enters their class and ancestry capitalized as
shown in the directions. Your program doesn't need to be case-insensitive as
long as it recognizes "Fighter", "Rogue", "Barbarian", "Orc", "Elf", and
"Gnome".</li>
</ul>

<p>In this assignment you will allow the user to choose whether to use the previous
point buy system or generate a set of random scores by simulating dice rolls.
You will also break these parts of your program into separate functions to make
them easier to test.</p>
<h2 id="autograded-3"><a class="header" href="#autograded-3">Autograded</a></h2>
<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<p>This program involves random numbers. Make sure you're following the random
number generation requirements for autograded assignments so that your code is
compatible with the tests.</p>
<h2 id="directions-3"><a class="header" href="#directions-3">Directions</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet4.java</code>.</li>
<li>Copy your work from the previous assignment into your file. This assignment
assumes you are starting from a working version of that program that passes
all of its tests.</li>
<li>Write a function named <code>buyScores</code> that takes no parameters and returns an
array of <code>int</code>s. This function must perform the same process used in the old
program for point buy, add the final scores to an array, and return the
array. You can cut and paste that code from your old <code>main</code> function into
this new <code>buyScores</code> function, then create and return the array after the
loop.</li>
<li>Write a function named <code>roll</code> that takes no parameters and returns an <code>int</code>.
This function must generate four random <code>int</code>s from 1 to 6, then return the
sum of the three largest numbers it generated. For example, if you generated
the numbers 4, 6, 2, and 5 then you would return 15 (4 + 6 + 5), ignoring
the 2. If there is a tie for lowest, then just ignore one of those values: 1,
1, 5, and 4 would result in 10 (1 + 5 + 4).</li>
<li>Write a function named <code>rollScores</code> that takes no parameters and returns an
array of <code>int</code>s. It must call the <code>roll</code> function three times, put the
results into an array, and return the array.</li>
<li>In your <code>main</code> function, remove the old ability score prompts and ask the
user whether they want to choose their scores. If they enter <code>y</code>, then
generate their scores by calling the <code>buyScores</code> function. If they enter <code>n</code>,
then generate their scores by calling the <code>rollScores</code> function. If they
enter anything else, then print an error message and ask again until they
enter <code>y</code> or <code>n</code>. Remember to store the return value from <code>buyScores</code> or
<code>rollScores</code> in a variable and copy the elements of that array to your
ability score variables. If you don't do this, then the rest of your program
will no longer work!</li>

<ul>
<li>Prompt for input in the same order as the previous assignment, but with the
added loop to choose whether to use point buy. If the user doesn't choose
point buy, then your program must not prompt the user for their ability
scores.</li>
<li>Print the following warning/error messages where appropriate, using the
erroneous input instead of the placeholder value. The quotes must still appear
in your output.
<ul>
<li><code>WARNING: The class "&lt;CLASS&gt;" is not supported by this program.</code></li>

<li><code>ERROR: You need to answer y or n.</code></li>
<li><code>ERROR: Ability scores must sum to 36 or less! Try again.</code></li>

<li>All calculations must be handled the same as in the previous assignment. Once
you have the ability scores, the rest of the program works exactly the same.</li>

only difference is in the score prompt and the additional error message that
can be generated.</li>

<li>This function must prompt the user for their ability scores until they enter
a set of scores that add up to 36 or less. It must also print the
appropriate error message each time they enter scores that add up to more
than 36. This process is exactly the same as in the previous assignment.</li>
