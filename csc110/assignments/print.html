<p>This site includes all assignments for our class. Deadlines can be found on
Blackboard and on the course schedule. Most assignments are autograded, and
these are subject to the rules in the <a href="./autograded.html">autograded assignments</a>
section. The autograded assignments are also grouped into two projects, and each
assignment in the series builds towards a larger program. You should complete
them in order so that you can reuse material from earlier assignments in the
series.</p>
<p>Finally, a reminder that you are responsible for knowing the relevant policies
in our syllabus and how they apply to these assignments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../syllabus/grading">Grading</a></li>
<li><a href="../syllabus/grading/deadlines">Deadlines</a></li>
<li><a href="../syllabus/ai">Academic Integrity and Accountability</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="autograded-assignments"><a class="header" href="#autograded-assignments">Autograded Assignments</a></h1>
<h2 id="testing"><a class="header" href="#testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p>Autograded assignments are subject to the submission limits given in the
deadline policy and will be checked by several programs I wrote to test student
code. These tests will run your program or its functions with different inputs
and check whether it produces the correct results.</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-accountability"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-and-accountability">Academic Integrity and Accountability</a></h3>
<p>Attempting to deliberately fool the test programs, hide malicious code in your
source file, or otherwise intentionally sabotage tests is not allowed and will
be treated as an AIA violation.</p>
<h3 id="test-criteria"><a class="header" href="#test-criteria">Test Criteria</a></h3>
<p>Tests will normally check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Output produced by <code>IO.println</code> and <code>IO.print</code>. Your program's output must
match any requirements given in the assignment. Any difference (wrong
spelling, capitalization, spacing, etc.) will fail an I/O test.</li>
<li>Values returned by your function. If your function returns a value, then the
value must match any requirements given in the assignment.</li>
<li>Modifications to array arguments passed to your function. If your function
takes any array parameters, then it must modify them as described in the
assignment's requirements. Any extra modifications will cause a test to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your programs should avoid printing trailing whitespace (such as spaces at the
end of a line) and should end their output with a <code>println</code> rather than a
<code>print</code>, but the autograder (as of 11/14) will take the following steps to
normalize your output:</p>
<ul>
<li>trim trailing whitespace</li>
<li>delete any blank lines or lines that only contain whitespace</li>
<li>add a newline to the end of your output if one is missing</li>
</ul>
<p>This means trailing whitespace, blank lines, and whether or not your output ends
in a newline <strong>should not</strong> cause your program to fail any I/O tests. Spaces in
the middle of a line or at the beginning of a line will still affect the outcome
of a test.</p>
<p>Tests will always ignore any output produced by <code>IO.readln</code>. I never specify how
exactly to prompt the user for input, so you may word these prompts however you
want. The tests will only look at output from <code>IO.print</code> and <code>IO.println</code>. This
also means you shouldn't use <code>IO.readln</code> to print any of the required output.</p>
<p>A few other ways for a test to fail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompting for additional input or prompting in the wrong order. The test
provides input in the order described in the assignment, so your code needs to
read it in the same order.</li>
<li>Printing output in the wrong order, combining separate lines into the same
line, or splitting up one line into several lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="random-numbers"><a class="header" href="#random-numbers">Random Numbers</a></h3>
<p>If your program needs to generate random numbers, then it must use
<code>Math.random()</code> to generate the number and scale, adjust, and round this value
as needed. For example, <code>(int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1</code> generates a random
integer from 1 to 6.</p>
<p>Your program must also avoid generating unnecessary random numbers. The tests
will seed the random number generator to ensure your code receives the same
sequence of "random" values that were used when generating the expected output,
and generating extra random numbers in your code will change this sequence and
cause you to fail tests.</p>
<h2 id="test-feedback"><a class="header" href="#test-feedback">Test Feedback</a></h2>
<p>My test program will generate markdown, html, and pdf files with the results of
any failed tests. This feedback will provide some information about the failed
test to help you find and fix any mistakes in your program.</p>
<h2 id="code-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#code-restrictions">Code Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>To ensure your code is compatible with my tests, there are a few restrictions
you need to follow. Ignoring any of these restrictions will usually cause your
submission to fail all tests (or be marked invalid before even reaching the
tests), and in some cases it will flag your code for review as potentially
plagiarized or AI-generated.</p>
<p>These restrictions aren't a problem if you are writing your code as shown in
class and only write code that you understand. If you don't know what something
means and we haven't covered it in class (like a <code>static</code> modifier), then
there's no reason you'd write it into your program.</p>
<h3 id="compact-source"><a class="header" href="#compact-source">Compact Source</a></h3>
<p>You program must be a compact source file, and your <code>main</code> function must be
declared as <code>void main()</code>. You must not use <code>static</code> or any other modifiers with
your functions and variables.</p>
<h3 id="io-functions"><a class="header" href="#io-functions">I/O Functions</a></h3>
<p>Any I/O must use the <code>IO</code> functions we learned in class: <code>IO.readln</code>,
<code>IO.print</code>, and <code>IO.println</code>. No <code>System.out</code>, <code>Console</code>, or <code>Scanner</code>.</p>
<h3 id="standard-library"><a class="header" href="#standard-library">Standard Library</a></h3>
<p>The Java standard library is a useful tool, and you should learn how to use it.
However, these projects are meant to be completed with the limited tools we
cover in class, and the standard library can trivialize some problems that
you're meant to solve by hand. You're free to make use of any <code>String</code> methods,
any of the <code>IO</code> and <code>Math</code> functions we've covered, and parsing functions (like
<code>Integer.parseInt</code>). However, using other parts of the standard library that we
haven't covered, such as <code>System</code> or <code>Scanner</code>, is not allowed. You're also not
allowed to use any third-party libraries in autograded assignments.</p>
<h3 id="java-keywordsfeatures"><a class="header" href="#java-keywordsfeatures">Java Keywords/Features</a></h3>
<p>Your code should not declare classes, use try-catch, or otherwise rely on
advanced features of the language or use Java keywords that we haven't covered
in class. The tools you have are more than adequate to solve these problems, and
they allow for a variety of solutions to most of the programs.</p>
<h1 id="character-sheet-project"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet-project">Character Sheet Project</a></h1>
<p>This is some background information for the next four assignments. If you're not
interested in the background and just want to write the programs, then feel free
to skip this! You can code those programs without knowing anything about TTRPGs.</p>
<h2 id="dungeons-and-dragons"><a class="header" href="#dungeons-and-dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop roleplaying game</a>
(TTRPG). Even if you haven't played a TTRPG before, you've probably still heard
the name "Dungeons and Dragons" at some point. These assignments will use a
modified version of some character creation rules from D&amp;D 5e. The real rules
can be found in the <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/">5e System Reference Document</a>
(SRD), which you can read if you're curious and want to learn more. However, you
do not need to read the SRD for this assignment.</p>
<h2 id="character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet">Character Sheet</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind these assignments is to write a program that generates a
"character sheet" for someone playing a TTRPG like D&amp;D. A player normally
controls a fictional character (their Player Character, or PC), and they track
information about their character on a character sheet. This might include
statistics, like how strong or fast the character is, the character's
possessions, or information about the character's personality.</p>
<p>The character sheet you generate will not cover all of the information about a
real TTRPG character. This would get too complicated for an early programming
assignment. Instead, we'll use a small subset of rules from the SRD, some of
which will be simplified to better fit this assignment. You don't need to know
any of these rules! The assignments will explain any calculations your code
needs to perform.</p>
<h2 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>Below is a summary of some terms that will come up in this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character's <strong>class</strong> is the role they fill in the game's world. In a game
like D&amp;D, which focuses on fighting fantasy monsters, a character's class
tells us their role in combat. A wizard casts spells, a rogue sneaks up on
enemies, and a fighter... fights. Yes, everyone fights, but the fighter fights
more directly, like with a sword and shield.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ancestry</strong> or <strong>race</strong> (the term varies by game, but I'll
usually default to ancestry) represents what kind of creature they are. D&amp;D
includes a lot of your standard fantasy races: elf, human, dwarf, goblin,
gnome, halfling, and orc. However, depending on the game and who's running it,
a TTRPG character could be anything: a ghost, a dragon, a talking bear, or a
mannequin. I have run a game of D&amp;D that included both a talking bear and a
mannequin as player characters. The mannequin also talked, and his name was
Bob. The bear had a pet monkey. All of this will be on the exam<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#exam">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>hit points</strong> (HP) represent how difficult they are to defeat
in combat.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>armor class</strong> (AC) represents how hard they are to hit with an
attack. A high AC may mean that a character is very good at avoiding attacks,
or that a character is wearing armor that blocks most attacks.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability scores</strong> are numbers that represent a character's
strength, cunning, speed, and other innate qualities. These affect most
actions in the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability modifiers</strong> are bonuses or penalties derived from
their ability scores. The modifiers are the numbers we actually use in most
calculations, and the scores only exist to determine the modifiers. At this
point, you may be wondering why we bother with ability scores if we don't use
them after calculating the modifiers. Good question! Anyway, let's talk about
the character's level.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>level</strong> represents how powerful and experienced they are. In
most TTRPGs, characters gain experience and level up to represent how they've
grown during their adventures.</li>
<li>In addition to standard six-sided dice (referred to as D6 dice), D&amp;D uses
several less common dice shapes: D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="assignment-1"><a class="header" href="#assignment-1">Assignment 1</a></h1>
<p>In this assignment you will write a program that prompts the user for
information and prints this information to the terminal. You'll also perform a
few operations to show that the information was parsed as the correct type.</p>
<h2 id="autograded"><a class="header" href="#autograded">Autograded</a></h2>
<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<h2 id="directions"><a class="header" href="#directions">Directions</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet1.java</code>.</li>
<li>Prompt the user for the following information (in order):
<ul>
<li>The player's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's name (String)</li>
<li>The character's class (String)</li>
<li>The character's ancestry (String)</li>
<li>The character's level (int)</li>
<li>The character's strength score (int)</li>
<li>The character's dexterity score (int)</li>
<li>The character's constitution score (int)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print each of these values back in the same order (player name, character
name, etc.). Each value should be printed on a separate line. Print only the
value, no label!</li>
<li>Print the sum of the level, strength score, dexterity score, and constitution
score.</li>
</ol>
<p>One problem you might run into with this program is that "class" is a Java
keyword. It would be natural to use class as the name for the variable that
holds the character's class, but Java won't allow keywords as identifiers. The
name "clazz" is sometimes used as a workaround, but any other name that still
conveys the purpose of the variable is fine.</p>
<h2 id="submission"><a class="header" href="#submission">Submission</a></h2>
<p>Upload your <code>CharacterSheet1.java</code> file using the submission link on Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The directions cover all requirements for this assignment. This section will
normally explain additional details not included with the directions.</p>
<h1 id="assignment-2"><a class="header" href="#assignment-2">Assignment 2</a></h1>
<p>In this assignment you will add some formatting to your output and perform some
calculations that would be used in a real 5e character sheet according to the
SRD (see <a href="./character_sheet.html">background</a> page for more information).</p>
<h2 id="autograded-1"><a class="header" href="#autograded-1">Autograded</a></h2>
<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<h2 id="directions-1"><a class="header" href="#directions-1">Directions</a></h2>
<p>These directions will use arrow brackets (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>) to mark placeholder
values in the output. Your code should print the relevant value instead of the
arrow brackets and whatever text is between them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet2.java</code>.</li>
<li>Prompt for the same input as the previous assignment.</li>
<li>Calculate the character's <strong>proficiency bonus</strong> using the formula in the
requirements section.</li>
<li>For each <strong>ability score</strong> (strength, dexterity, constitution), calculate a
corresponding <strong>ability modifier</strong> using the formula in the requirements
section.</li>
<li>Print the player's name formatted as <code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code>. For example, if the
player's name is "Bob" then your code would print "Player: Bob".</li>
<li>Print the character's name, level, ancestry, and class formatted as
<code>&lt;NAME&gt;, Level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code>. For example, if the character's
name was "Elrond", their level was 20, their ancestry was "Elf", and their
class was "Cleric", then your code would print "Elrond, Level 20 Elf Cleric".</li>
<li>Print the proficiency bonus in the format <code>Proficiency: &lt;PROFICIENCY&gt;</code>. For
example, if the character's level is 7, then their proficiency bonus is 3

<li>Print each ability name ("Strength", "Dexterity", "Constitution"), score, and
modifier in the following format: <code>&lt;NAME&gt;: &lt;SCORE&gt;, &lt;MODIFIER&gt;</code>. For example,
if the character's strength score is 15, then their modifier is 2 (using the
aforementioned formula) and your code will print "Strength: 15, 2". Each
ability must be printed on a separate line.</li>

<ul>
<li>Prompt for input in the same order as the previous assignment.</li>
<li>Print values in the order given in the directions. Abilities must be printed
in the order strength, dexterity, constitution.</li>
<li>Use the following formulas for your calculations:

<li>proficiency bonus: <code>(level + 3) / 4 + 1</code></li>
<li>ability modifier: <code>score / 2 - 5</code></li>

<p>Note: ability scores and ability modifiers are two separate numbers. You get the
score from user input, and you calculate the modifier using a formula. The score
remains the same after this calculation. "Modifier" is just the term used for
this number; it doesn't actual change the score.</p>
<h2 id="output-sample"><a class="header" href="#output-sample">Output Sample</a></h2>

<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<h2 id="directions-2"><a class="header" href="#directions-2">Directions</a></h2>
<p>The requirements section will show the exact wording required for any
warning/error messages printed by your code and the formulas required for any
calculations. Anything not specified in this assignment should remain as it was
in the previous assignment.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet3.java</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy your work from the previous assignment into your file. This assignment
assumes you are starting from a working version of that program that passes
all of its tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user inputs their class, check whether they chose one of the
following options: "Fighter", "Rogue", or "Barbarian". If they chose a
different class, then print a warning message to let them know their class
isn't supported by our program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user inputs their ancestry, check whether they chose one of the
following options: "Orc", "Elf", or "Gnome". If they chose a different
ancestry, then print a warning message to let them know their ancestry isn't
supported by our program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After you prompt the user for their ability scores, check whether those
scores sum to more than 36. If they sum to more than 36, then print an error
message and prompt the user for new ability scores. Repeat this process until
the user enters a set of scores that sum to 36 or less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user enters a set of valid ability scores and <strong>before</strong> you
calculate ability modifiers, make the following adjustment based on the
character's ancestry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Orc: increase their strength score by 2</li>
<li>Elf: increase their dexterity score by 2</li>
<li>Gnome: increase their constitution score by 2</li>
<li>Other (they chose an unsupported ancestry): don't change any scores</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: it's okay if this raises the total above 36! We're only enforcing that
rule for the unadjusted scores we get from the user in the previous step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the "hit die" depending on the character's class:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighter: 10</li>
<li>Rogue: 8</li>
<li>Barbarian: 12</li>
<li>Other (they chose an unsupported class): 6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the character's proficiency bonus, ability modifiers, hit points,
armor class, and attack using the formulas given in the requirements. Those
last three depend on the ability modifiers and proficiency, so calculate them
last.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When printing the character sheet, add the following three lines before the
proficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Hit Points(D&lt;HIT DIE&gt;): &lt;HIT POINTS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Armor Class: &lt;ARMOR CLASS&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Attack: &lt;ATTACK&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Upload your <code>CharacterSheet3.java</code> file using the submission link on Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-2"><a class="header" href="#requirements-2">Requirements</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Prompt for input in the same order as the previous assignment, but with the
added loop to enforce the maxmimum ability score total described in the
directions.</li>
<li>Print the following warning/error messages where appropriate, using the
erroneous input instead of the placeholder value. The quotes must still appear
in your output.
<ul>
<li><code>WARNING: The class "&lt;CLASS&gt;" is not supported by this program.</code></li>
<li><code>WARNING: The ancestry "&lt;ANCESTRY&gt;" is not supported by this program.</code></li>
<li><code>ERROR: Ability scores must sum to 36 or less! Try again.</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use the following formulas for your calculations:
<ul>
<li>proficiency bonus: <code>(level + 3) / 4 + 1</code></li>
<li>ability modifier: <code>score / 2 - 5</code></li>
<li>hit points: <code>level * (hit die + constitution modifier)</code></li>
<li>armor class: <code>10 + proficiency bonus + dexterity modifier</code></li>
<li>attack: <code>proficiency bonus + strength modifier</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may assume the user always enters their class and ancestry capitalized as
shown in the directions. Your program doesn't need to be case-insensitive as
long as it recognizes "Fighter", "Rogue", "Barbarian", "Orc", "Elf", and
"Gnome".</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet4.java</code>.</li>
<li>Copy your work from the previous assignment into your file. This assignment
assumes you are starting from a working version of that program that passes
all of its tests.</li>
<li>Write a function named <code>buyScores</code> that takes no parameters and returns an
array of <code>int</code>s. The previous assignment implemented a simplified "point buy"
system: the user can choose any three numbers for their ability scores as
long as these numbers add up to 36 or less. Your <code>buyScores</code> function must
perform that same process used in the previous assignment and return the
scores as an <code>int</code> array. You've already written most of this function: just
copy and paste that point buy process from your old <code>main</code> function into this
new <code>buyScores</code> function, then create and return the array after the loop.</li>
<li>Write a function named <code>roll</code> that takes no parameters and returns an <code>int</code>.
This function must generate four random <code>int</code>s from 1 to 6, then return the
sum of the three largest numbers it generated. For example, if you generated
the numbers 4, 6, 2, and 5 then you would return 15 (4 + 6 + 5), ignoring
the 2. If there is a tie for lowest, then just ignore one of those values: 1,
1, 5, and 4 would result in 10 (1 + 5 + 4).</li>
<li>Write a function named <code>rollScores</code> that takes no parameters and returns an
array of <code>int</code>s. It must call the <code>roll</code> function three times, put the
results into an array, and return the array.</li>
<li>In your <code>main</code> function, remove the old ability score prompts and ask the
user whether they want to choose their scores. If they enter <code>y</code>, then
generate their scores by calling the <code>buyScores</code> function. If they enter <code>n</code>,
then generate their scores by calling the <code>rollScores</code> function. If they
enter anything else, then print an error message and ask again until they
enter <code>y</code> or <code>n</code>. Remember to store the return value from <code>buyScores</code> or
<code>rollScores</code> in a variable and copy the elements of that array to your
ability score variables. If you don't do this, then the rest of your program
will no longer work!</li>

<p>This is some background information for assignments 5-8. You should familiarize
yourself with the rules of Yahtzee before starting these assignments.</p>
<h2 id="yahtzee"><a class="header" href="#yahtzee">Yahtzee</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee">Yahtzee</a> is a game played with five dice
per player over 13 rounds. Each player's goal is to earn the most points by the
end of the game. A round of Yahtzee consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each player rolls all of their dice.</li>
<li>Each player chooses any number of their dice to reroll and rerolls all of the
chosen dice at the same time. They can then repeat this process one more
time.</li>
<li>Each player chooses one of thirteen categories on their scorecard. Each
category can only be chosen once per player and is worth points based on the
dice rolled. For example, choosing the yahtzee category is worth 50 points if
all of your dice show the same number and 0 points otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of the game, each player adds up their points. The player with the
most points wins.</p>
<h2 id="our-dice-game"><a class="header" href="#our-dice-game">Our Dice Game</a></h2>
<p>We'll be coding a dice game with most of the same rules as Yahtzee, but we'll
leave out or simplify a few rules. Our game will be single-player, with one
person playing on the terminal by typing in commands and trying to earn the
highest possible score.</p>
<h1 id="assignment-5"><a class="header" href="#assignment-5">Assignment 5</a></h1>

left. Inside the loop:
<ul>
<li>Print the dice using <code>printDice</code> and prompt the user for a command.</li>
<li>If the user enters "skip", then set their rerolls to 0. This should end the

<li>If the user doesn't meet the 3/4 of a kind requirement, then these
categories are worth 0 points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Yahtzee category is worth 50 points if all of the dice are the same and 0
points otherwise.</li>
<li>The chance category is always worth the sum of all dice.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="io"><a class="header" href="#io">I/O</a></h3>
<p>The expected format for printing scores is:</p>
<pre><code>Score Categories:

1. Aces: X
2. Twos: X
3. Threes: X
4. Fours: X
5. Fives: X
6. Sixes: X
7. 3 of a Kind: X
8. 4 of a Kind: X
9. Yahtzee: X
10. Chance: X
</code></pre>
<p>Note the blank line between "Score Categories:" and the list. Each "X" should be
replaced with the score the user would receive for that category. You can print
this with a loop if you put the category names in an array and iterate over the
array, but remember that the numbers next to the categories are 1 greater than
the corresponding array index. Here's some code to create an array with all the
category names:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">String[] names = new String[] {
    "Aces",
    "Twos",
    "Threes",
    "Fours",
    "Fives",
    "Sixes",
    "3 of a Kind",
    "4 of a Kind",
    "Yahtzee",
    "Chance"
};

<h2 id="autograded-7"><a class="header" href="#autograded-7">Autograded</a></h2>
<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<p>This program involves random numbers. Make sure you're following the random
number generation requirements for autograded assignments so that your code is
compatible with the tests.</p>
<h2 id="directions-7"><a class="header" href="#directions-7">Directions</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>DiceGame4.java</code> and start with a copy of
your code from the previous assignment.</li>
<li>Modify your <code>printScores</code> function to take two parameters: an array of ten
scores and an array of five dice. The array of scores represents scores from
previous rounds, with a negative value indicating a category that hasn't been
selected. When you print each category:
<ul>
<li>if the score in the array isn't negative, show that number instead of
calculating a score with the dice</li>
<li>if the score in the array is negative, show "available (X)", where X is the
score calculated for the given dice, to indicate that the user can choose
this category and would receive the amount of points shown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify your <code>playRound</code> function to take a parameter for the scores array.
You'll need to pass this array when you print the scores. Make the following
changes to the scoring part of the function:
<ul>
<li>After printing the dice and before prompting for a score category, call
your <code>printScores</code> function to show which categories are available and how
many points they're worth.</li>
<li>Change your input validation to ensure the user chooses a category from 1
to 10 with a negative score. Remember to subtract 1 from the category
number before using it to index the scores array (categories are 1-10, but
score indexes are 0-9).</li>
<li>Change the error message to <code>ERROR: You cannot score category X.</code>, where X
is the user's invalid input. The old message doesn't make sense now that
we're choosing from ten categories instead of six die values.</li>
<li>Store the user's score in the scores array at the appropriate index.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modify your <code>main</code> function to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Create an array of ten scores and initialize each element to -1.</li>
<li>Call your <code>playRound</code> function ten times (use a loop), passing it the
scores array as an argument. It will add one score to the array with each
round, replacing the negative number.</li>
<li>Find the total score after ten rounds and print
<code>Game Over! Your total score is: X.</code>, replacing X with the total score.</li>
<li>Print the score categories one more time. You'll need to pass it an array
for the dice, even though it won't use the array, so just make a new
temporary array and pass that as the second argument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="submission-7"><a class="header" href="#submission-7">Submission</a></h2>

<h3 id="io-1"><a class="header" href="#io-1">I/O</a></h3>
<h4 id="scores"><a class="header" href="#scores">Scores</a></h4>
<p>The <code>printScores</code> function must show which categories are available (negative
value in the scores array) along with a score calculated for the given dice. For
other categories, it must show the score in the scores array. The sample below
is for a score array of -1, -1, -1, 12, 5, -1, 23, -1, 50, 11 and a dice array
of 6, 6, 6, 5, 6.</p>
<pre><code>Score Categories:

1. Aces: available (0)
2. Twos: available (0)
3. Threes: available (0)
4. Fours: 12
5. Fives: 5
6. Sixes: available (24)
7. 3 of a Kind: 23
8. 4 of a Kind: available (29)
9. Yahtzee: 50
10. Chance: 11
</code></pre>
<h4 id="main"><a class="header" href="#main"><code>main</code></a></h4>
<p>Most of your output will be produced by <code>playRound</code> and the functions it calls.
Your <code>main</code> only needs to produce two pieces of output at the end of the game.
First, the message showing your final score:</p>
<pre><code>Game Over! Your total score is: 166.
</code></pre>
<p>Then the <code>printScores</code> output to show the final score in each category:</p>
<pre><code>Score Categories:

1. Aces: 2
2. Twos: 8
3. Threes: 6
4. Fours: 12
5. Fives: 5
6. Sixes: 24
7. 3 of a Kind: 23
8. 4 of a Kind: 25
9. Yahtzee: 50
10. Chance: 11
</code></pre>
<h4 id="playround"><a class="header" href="#playround"><code>playRound</code></a></h4>
<p>Your <code>playRound</code> function needs to produce output in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>In each iteration of the reroll phase (this is exactly the same as in previous
versions, but I'm including it here for completeness):
<ul>
<li>Print the dice</li>
<li>If the user entered an invalid command, print the appropriate error message</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the beginning of the score phase (before prompting the user for any input):
<ul>
<li>Print the dice</li>
<li>Print the scores</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For each invalid input received while prompting for a score category:
<ul>
<li>Print the appropriate error message</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After getting a valid score category:
<ul>
<li>The message announcing how many points the user received</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="final-project"><a class="header" href="#final-project">Final Project</a></h1>
<p>The final project is an open-ended assignment. You're free to explore any topic
that interests you, as long as it is relevant to CSC110 and you can produce a
working program to demo at the end of the semester.</p>
<p>This assignment counts as two normal assignments for the purpose of final
grades:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submitting the program and other required material on time counts as one
completed assignment</li>
<li>Participating in the in-class demos and discussing your program with me counts
as one completed assignment</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="groups"><a class="header" href="#groups">Groups</a></h2>
<p>You can complete this project on your own or work in a group. Groups must be
established in your proposal, and all group members must be present when making
the proposal.</p>
<h2 id="proposal"><a class="header" href="#proposal">Proposal</a></h2>
<p>Before you begin the project, you must present the idea for your project during
class or during my in-person office hours. I will reserve some time at the end
of class meetings for these proposals.</p>
<p>A proposal should take no more than five minutes to present and must answer the
questions below. You can format this information however you want as long as it
can be displayed with your laptop.</p>
<ol>
<li>Who is working on the project?</li>
<li>What will your program do when the project is complete?</li>
<li>What do you expect to learn from creating this program? Different group
members may have different learning goals depending on how the work is
divided.</li>
<li>If working in a group, what is the primary responsibility of each group
member? Everyone must contribute substantially to the code written for a
group project. I expect group projects to be large enough that each member
can "own" a specific part of the program, even if other portions are a shared
responsibility.</li>
<li>What are some concrete objectives that can be used to assess whether you have
completed the project? These are the criteria I will use to grade the
submitted program.</li>
</ol>
<p>I may ask for changes before approving your project. When assessing a proposal,
I will consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you address everything listed above?</li>
<li>Are your objectives clear enough that I can use them to assess your finished
program?</li>
<li>Does the project have a clear and reasonable scope? Projects that are too
ambitious to complete in a few weeks or so small as to be trivial aren't
suitable for this assignment. Let's assume you will work on this for three
weeks and spend 2-5 hours per week. That means it should involve somewhere
from 5 to 15 hours of work per group member to complete. This does not include
unproductive time, like spending two hours debugging a small problem that
would have taken a few minutes if you had asked for help. If you spend time
poorly, then expect to spend significantly more than the estimated 5-15 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Final projects will not be accepted without an approved proposal. If, while
working on the project, you wish to make significant changes from what was
covered in your proposal, then you must present an updated proposal for the new
version by the proposal deadline. If you don't do this, or if I don't approve
the new version, then you will be held to the version that I did approve.</p>
<p>All material used for your presentation must be uploaded to Blackboard before
you present it. If we don't have enough time for everyone who wishes to present
on a given day, then I will prioritize groups based on how early their material
was uploaded to Blackboard.</p>
<p>Finally, a reminder not to use an LLM or other AI tool to write your proposal or
generate material for a proposal. I want to hear <em>you</em> explain <em>your idea</em> for
<em>your project</em>. Unauthorized AI use or plagiarism on the proposal will be
treated just as seriously as if you had cheated on the program.</p>
<h2 id="demo-1-point"><a class="header" href="#demo-1-point">Demo (1 Point)</a></h2>
<p>At the end of the semester, either during the last week of class or during our
final exam period, we will demo final projects. This will be an informal
process: each group who completed a project should have their program ready to
run on a laptop, and all students will be free to wander around and check out
other project demos. Be prepared to explain your program, show how it works,
and, if you're comfortable doing so, allow other people to try using it.</p>
<p>I will look at every project during this time and ask each group to demonstrate
their finished program. Presenting your work on this day is worth 1 completed
assignment. To receive credit, you must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Be present for this class meeting.</li>
<li>Have a working program that matches what you described in your proposal.</li>
<li>Help demonstrate your program to me and answer questions about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you cannot attend the demo and want to schedule a make-up, then I expect you
to notify me as early as possible and explain why you cannot attend. I will only
allow make-ups if notified promptly and if the absence was necessary (not, for
example, because you decided to go on a vacation that day or wanted to leave
early for winter break).</p>
<h2 id="program-submission-1-point"><a class="header" href="#program-submission-1-point">Program Submission (1 Point)</a></h2>
<p>Your finished program must be submitted on Blackboard before the deadline. This
submission on its own is worth 1 completed assignment, provided the following
requirements are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>The program is submitted on time.</li>
<li>The program compiles, runs, and is what you described in your proposal. It
must meet your stated objectives or be reasonably close to meeting each
objective.</li>
<li>Your program should be runnable with the <code>java</code> command on your main source
file. If it requires additional steps to compile/run, then include
compile/run instructions with your submission.</li>
<li>Your program should provide clear prompts and directions for the user. If a
user would need to know something that the program doesn't explain to them,
then include instructions for using the program with your submission. The
user should not have to read your code to understand how to use the program.</li>
<li>If your program has significant bugs or there was a problem meeting some of
your objectives, then you must include an explanation of these issues with
the submission. I expect to see a good faith effort towards completing each
objective, and the program must be close to meeting each objective even if
you ran into issues.</li>
<li>If you worked in a group, then your submission must include a summary of each
member's contributions to the project. These must be consistent with the
individual responsibilities given in your proposal.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="sample-proposal"><a class="header" href="#sample-proposal">Sample Proposal</a></h1>
<p>Below is an example proposal based on work I'll be doing to prepare week 12-14
material for this class. I chose to write it as a markdown file and render it to
html with <code>mdbook</code>, but remember that you can use whatever format you want for
your own proposal as long as you can present it on a laptop screen.</p>
<h2 id="proposal-terminal-game-demos"><a class="header" href="#proposal-terminal-game-demos">Proposal: Terminal Game Demos</a></h2>
<p>Author(s): Zach Kohlberg</p>
<p>Program Summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several small programs demonstrating various topics, such as File I/O,
exception handling, ANSI escape sequences, enums, and networking.</li>
<li>One larger program that implements a Wordle-like game, either as a
single-player game or, if time permits, as a two-player game played over a
network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>I know relatively little about ANSI escapes and will have fun learning to code
some TUI features from scratch.</li>
<li>I've written network code in Java before, but I'm curious to see how much I
can simplify a networked program to make it accessible to CSC110 students. I
think I can avoid some of the topics I'd normally need to cover for such a
program:
<ul>
<li>Multithreading isn't necessary if we keep our program to two users and don't
try to handle any errors that might occur. This also removes the need for a
queue or any concurrent data structures to handle incoming messages or allow
users to join/reconnect in the middle of the game.</li>
<li>We can avoid introducing any GUI elements if we just print to the terminal,
and we can use ANSI escapes to avoid mangling user input with new output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Concrete Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate example programs, each demonstrating a simple usecase for one of the
following topics:
<ul>
<li>Exception handling</li>
<li>File I/O</li>
<li>Enums</li>
<li>ANSI escapes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A functioning Password/Wordle-like terminal game, probably single-player, that
uses some of the above topics (minimally reads a word list file to establish
valid word choices)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Goals (time permitting, not part of grading criteria):</p>
<ul>
<li>Example programs covering:
<ul>
<li>Additional reader/writer classes from the standard library</li>
<li>Minimal networking code for a two-user chatroom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Make the game two-player over a TCP connection</li>
</ul>
