<p>This site includes all assignments for our class. Deadlines can be found on
Blackboard and on the course schedule. Most assignments are autograded, and
these are subject to the rules in the <a href="./autograded.html">autograded assignments</a>
section. The autograded assignments are also grouped into two projects, and each
assignment in the series builds towards a larger program. You should complete
them in order so that you can reuse material from earlier assignments in the
series.</p>
<p>Finally, a reminder that you are responsible for knowing the relevant policies
in our syllabus and how they apply to these assignments, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../syllabus/grading">Grading</a></li>
<li><a href="../syllabus/grading/deadlines">Deadlines</a></li>
<li><a href="../syllabus/ai">Academic Integrity and Accountability</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="autograded-assignments"><a class="header" href="#autograded-assignments">Autograded Assignments</a></h1>
<h2 id="testing"><a class="header" href="#testing">Testing</a></h2>
<p>Autograded assignments are subject to the submission limits given in the
deadline policy and will be checked by several programs I wrote to test student
code. These tests will run your program or its functions with different inputs
and check whether it produces the correct results.</p>
<p>Tests will normally check the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Output produced by <code>IO.println</code> and <code>IO.print</code>. Your program's output must
match any requirements given in the assignment. Any difference (wrong
spelling, capitalization, etc.) will fail an I/O test.</li>
<li>Values returned by your function. If your function returns a value, then the
value must match any requirements given in the assignment.</li>
<li>Modifications to array arguments passed to your function. If your function
takes any array parameters, then it must modify them as described in the
assignment's requirements. Any extra modifications will usually cause a test
to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tests will always ignore any output produced by <code>IO.readln</code>. I will never
specify how exactly to prompt the user for input, so you may word these prompts
however you want. The tests will only look at your <code>print</code> and <code>println</code> output.</p>
<p>A few other ways for a test to fail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prompting for additional input or prompting in the wrong order. The test
provides input in the order described in the assignment, so your code needs to
read it in the same order.</li>
<li>Printing output in the wrong order, combining separate lines into the same
line, or splitting up one line into several lines.</li>
<li>Generating extra random numbers. If a program involves random numbers, then
the random number generator is "seeded" so that it produces the same sequence
of values for your code that were used to generate the expected output. If you
generate more random numbers than you need, then the sequence won't match and
your code will produce different output.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test-feedback"><a class="header" href="#test-feedback">Test Feedback</a></h2>
<p>My test program will generate markdown and pdf files with the results of any
failed tests. This feedback will provide some information about the failed test
to help you find and fix any mistakes in your program.</p>
<h2 id="code-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#code-restrictions">Code Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>To ensure your code is compatible with my tests, there are a few restrictions
you need to follow. Ignoring any of these restrictions will usually cause your
submission to fail all tests (or be marked invalid before even reaching the
tests), and in some cases it will flag your code for review as potentially
plagiarized or AI-generated.</p>
<p>These restrictions aren't a problem if you are writing your code as shown in
class and only write code that you understand. If you don't know what something
means (like a <code>static</code> modifier), then you probably don't need to worry about
using it by accident.</p>
<h3 id="compact-source"><a class="header" href="#compact-source">Compact Source</a></h3>
<p>You program must be a compact source file, and your <code>main</code> function must be
declared as <code>void main()</code>. You must not use <code>static</code> or any other modifiers with
your functions and variables.</p>
<h3 id="io-functions"><a class="header" href="#io-functions">I/O Functions</a></h3>
<p>Any I/O must use the <code>IO</code> functions we learned in class: <code>IO.readln</code>,
<code>IO.print</code>, and <code>IO.println</code>. No <code>System.out</code>, <code>Console</code>, or <code>Scanner</code>.</p>
<!-- ## Random Numbers -->
<!---->
<!-- TODO: either make tests work with Math.random() strategy or make students use -->
<!-- csc110 library's random functions. -->
<h3 id="standard-library"><a class="header" href="#standard-library">Standard Library</a></h3>
<p>The Java standard library is a useful tool, and you should learn how to use it.
However, these projects are meant to be completed with the limited tools we
cover in class, and the standard library can trivialize some problems that
you're meant to solve by hand. You're free to make use of any <code>String</code> methods,
any of the <code>IO</code> and <code>Math</code> functions we've covered, and parsing functions (like
<code>Integer.parseInt</code>). However, using other parts of the standard library that we
haven't covered, such as <code>System</code> or <code>Scanner</code>, is not allowed. You're also not
allowed to use any third-party libraries in autograded assignments.</p>
<h3 id="java-keywordsfeatures"><a class="header" href="#java-keywordsfeatures">Java Keywords/Features</a></h3>
<p>Your code should not declare classes, use try-catch, or otherwise rely on
advanced features of the language that we haven't covered in class. The tools
you have are more than adequate to solve these problems, and they allow for a
variety of solutions to most of the programs.</p>
<h3 id="other"><a class="header" href="#other">Other</a></h3>
<p>Attempting to deliberately fool the test program, hide malicious code in your
source file, or otherwise intentionally sabotage tests is not allowed and will
be treated as an AIA violation.</p>
<h1 id="character-sheet-project"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet-project">Character Sheet Project</a></h1>
<p>This is some background information for the next four assignments. If you're not
interested in the background and just want to write the programs, then feel free
to skip this! You can code those programs without knowing anything about TTRPGs.</p>
<h2 id="dungeons-and-dragons"><a class="header" href="#dungeons-and-dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons and Dragons</a> is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">tabletop roleplaying game</a>
(TTRPG). Even if you haven't played a TTRPG before, you've probably still heard
the name "Dungeons and Dragons" at some point. These assignments will use a
modified version of some character creation rules from D&amp;D 5e. The real rules
can be found in the <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/">5e System Reference Document</a>
(SRD), which you can read if you're curious and want to learn more. However, you
do not need to read the SRD for this assignment.</p>
<h2 id="character-sheet"><a class="header" href="#character-sheet">Character Sheet</a></h2>
<p>The idea behind these assignments is to write a program that generates a
"character sheet" for someone playing a TTRPG like D&amp;D. A player normally
controls a fictional character (their Player Character, or PC), and they track
information about their character on a character sheet. This might include
statistics, like how strong or fast the character is, the character's
possessions, or information about the character's personality.</p>
<p>The character sheet you generate will not cover all of the information about a
real TTRPG character. This would get too complicated for an early programming
assignment. Instead, we'll use a small subset of rules from the SRD, some of
which will be simplified to better fit this assignment. You don't need to know
any of these rules! The assignments will explain any calculations your code
needs to perform.</p>
<h2 id="terminology"><a class="header" href="#terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>Below is a summary of some terms that will come up in this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A character's <strong>class</strong> is the role they fill in the game's world. In a game
like D&amp;D, which focuses on fighting fantasy monsters, a character's class
tells us their role in combat. A wizard casts spells, a rogue sneaks up on
enemies, and a fighter... fights. Yes, everyone fights, but the fighter fights
more directly, like with a sword and shield.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ancestry</strong> or <strong>race</strong> (the term varies by game, but I'll
usually default to ancestry) represents what kind of creature they are. D&amp;D
includes a lot of your standard fantasy races: elf, human, dwarf, goblin,
gnome, halfling, and orc. However, depending on the game and who's running it,
a TTRPG character could be anything: a ghost, a dragon, a talking bear, or a
mannequin. I have run a game of D&amp;D that included both a talking bear and a
mannequin as player characters. The mannequin also talked, and his name was
Bob. The bear had a pet monkey. All of this will be on the exam<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#exam">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>hit points</strong> (HP) represent how difficult they are to defeat
in combat.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>armor class</strong> (AC) represents how hard they are to hit with an
attack. A high AC may mean that a character is very good at avoiding attacks,
or that a character is wearing armor that blocks most attacks.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability scores</strong> are numbers that represent a character's
strength, cunning, speed, and other innate qualities. These affect most
actions in the game.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>ability modifiers</strong> are bonuses or penalties derived from
their ability scores. The modifiers are the numbers we actually use in most
calculations, and the scores only exist to determine the modifiers. At this
point, you may be wondering why we bother with ability scores if we don't use
them after calculating the modifiers. Good question! Anyway, let's talk about
the character's level.</li>
<li>A character's <strong>level</strong> represents how powerful and experienced they are. In
most TTRPGs, characters gain experience and level up to represent how they've
grown during their adventures.</li>
<li>In addition to standard six-sided dice (referred to as D6 dice), D&amp;D uses
several less common dice shapes: D4, D8, D10, D12, and D20.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The directions cover all requirements for this assignment. This section will
normally explain additional details not included with the directions.</p>
<h1 id="assignment-2"><a class="header" href="#assignment-2">Assignment 2</a></h1>
<p>In this assignment you will add some formatting to your output and perform some
calculations that would be used in a real 5e character sheet according to the
SRD (see <a href="./character_sheet.html">background</a> page for more information).</p>
<h2 id="autograded-1"><a class="header" href="#autograded-1">Autograded</a></h2>
<p>This is an autograded assignment. Read the
<a href="./autograded.html">Autograded Assignments</a> page before starting.</p>
<h2 id="directions-1"><a class="header" href="#directions-1">Directions</a></h2>
<p>These directions will use arrow brackets (<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>) to mark placeholder
values in the output. Your code should print the relevant value instead of the
arrow brackets and whatever text is between them.</p>
<ol>
<li>Write this program in a file named <code>CharacterSheet2.java</code>.</li>
<li>Prompt for the same input as the previous assignment.</li>
<li>Calculate the character's <strong>proficiency bonus</strong> using the formula in the
requirements section.</li>
<li>For each <strong>ability score</strong> (strength, dexterity, constitution), calculate a
corresponding <strong>ability modifier</strong> using the formula in the requirements
section.</li>
<li>Print the player's name formatted as <code>Player: &lt;NAME&gt;</code>. For example, if the
player's name is "Bob" then your code would print "Player: Bob".</li>
<li>Print the character's name, level, ancestry, and class formatted as
<code>&lt;NAME&gt;, Level &lt;LEVEL&gt; &lt;ANCESTRY&gt; &lt;CLASS&gt;</code>. For example, if the character's
name was "Elrond", their level was 20, their ancestry was "Elf", and their
class was "Cleric", then your code would print "Elrond, Level 20 Elf Cleric".</li>
<li>Print the proficiency bonus in the format <code>Proficiency: &lt;PROFICIENCY&gt;</code>. For
example, if the character's level is 7, then their proficiency bonus is 3
(using the aforementioned formula) and your code will print "Proficiency: 3".</li>
<li>Print each ability name ("Strength", "Dexterity", "Constitution"), score, and
modifier in the following format: <code>&lt;NAME&gt;: &lt;SCORE&gt;, &lt;MODIFIER&gt;</code>. For example,
if the character's strength score is 15, then their modifier is 2 (using the
aforementioned formula) and your code will print "Strength: 15, 2". Each
ability must be printed on a separate line.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="submission-1"><a class="header" href="#submission-1">Submission</a></h2>
<p>Upload your <code>CharacterSheet2.java</code> file using the submission link on Blackboard.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-1"><a class="header" href="#requirements-1">Requirements</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Prompt for input in the same order as the previous assignment.</li>
<li>Print values in the order given in the directions. Abilities must be printed
in the order strength, dexterity, constitution.</li>
<li>Use the following formulas for your calculations:
<ul>
<li>proficiency bonus: <code>(level + 3) / 4 + 1</code></li>
<li>ability modifier: <code>score / 2 - 5</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: ability scores and ability modifiers are two separate numbers. You get the
score from user input, and you calculate the modifier using a formula. The score
remains the same after this calculation. "Modifier" is just the term used for
this number; it doesn't actual change the score.</p>
