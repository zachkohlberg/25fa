<h2 id="description"><a class="header" href="#description">Description</a></h2>
<p>CSC110 is an introduction to programming using the Java programming language.
The primary focus of this class is developing problem-solving skills and a
general knowledge of programming that will be useful to you in most programming
languages. While we will spend a lot of time learning about Java and how to
write good code, writing code isn't our ultimate goal. The most important skill
you can learn in this class is how to <em>think</em> like a programmer. Once you've
mastered that, writing code is surprisingly easy.</p>
<h2 id="objectives"><a class="header" href="#objectives">Objectives</a></h2>
<p>CSC110 and CSC110L share objectives. Upon successful completion of both courses,
students should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Discuss the challenges inherent in communicating with (programming) a
(non-reasoning) computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Break a complex problem down into smaller more manageable components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide step-by-step instructions to solve small computational problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using at least one programming language, write examples of and solve problems
in programs with the following basic programming constructs and tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mathematical expressions</li>
<li>Conditional expressions</li>
<li>Simple iterative statements</li>
<li>Simple functions</li>
<li>Simple data structures, such as arrays, lists, and strings</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss the importance of commenting and good code structure/style</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lab"><a class="header" href="#lab">Lab</a></h2>
<p>CSC110 and CSC110L are separate classes, usually with different instructors,
syllabi, and Blackboard pages. Your final grade in CSC110 is based only on your
work in CSC110, and your final grade in CSC110L is based only on your work in
CSC110L. These final grades may therefore differ.</p>
<!-- This syllabus is primarily written for CSC110, but I also use it when I teach -->
<!-- CSC110L. If you have a different instructor for each class, then this syllabus -->
<!-- only applies to the class you are taking with me. -->
<h1 id="communication-and-office-hours"><a class="header" href="#communication-and-office-hours">Communication and Office Hours</a></h1>
<h2 id="office-hours"><a class="header" href="#office-hours">Office Hours</a></h2>
<p>I am a part-time faculty member and do not have an office on campus. If I am
available for in person office hours, then it will be noted in a schedule posted
to Blackboard. These times do not require an appointment.</p>
<p>We can also schedule a remote meeting on a weekday if you are not able to attend
my in-person office hours. If you'd like to meet remotely, then please send me
an email with your availability over the next several days. I'll try to find a
time that works for both of us and schedule a Zoom meeting.</p>
<h2 id="blackboard"><a class="header" href="#blackboard">Blackboard</a></h2>
<p>I will post or link to all course material and assignments on Blackboard. If you
want to find something or submit an assignment, go to our Blackboard site and
look in the appropriate page. If you think I forgot to post something, then send
me an email and I'll either post it or tell you where to find it.</p>
<h2 id="email"><a class="header" href="#email">Email</a></h2>
<p>My email is <a href="mailto:zckohlberg@qu.edu">zckohlberg@qu.edu</a>. I check my email most weekdays and try to
respond to all emails within 24 hours. If you email me after Friday morning or
on the weekend, then I probably won't see it until Monday. You're still welcome
to email me at any time.</p>
<p>I will answer most questions via email if you don't want to ask in person. If
you're asking for help with an assignment or other coding issue, then please
attach your code (the text file, not a screenshot). Try to include as much
relevant information as possible and be specific about what you want to know.
This helps me give you a useful answer more quickly.</p>
<p>If you want me to do something more involved than answer a few questions, such
as review your code or help you debug a program, then you should meet with me
during office hours. I'm happy to help you with coding, debugging, and other
tasks as long as you're the one doing the task. You should not come to office
hours or send an email expecting me to do your work for you.</p>
<h1 id="class-meetings"><a class="header" href="#class-meetings">Class Meetings</a></h1>
<h2 id="instructor-absence"><a class="header" href="#instructor-absence">Instructor Absence</a></h2>
<p>I may hold class remotely via Zoom while sick or otherwise unable to attend in
person. If I need to cancel class, then I will notify everyone as early as
possible in a Blackboard announcement.</p>
<h2 id="class-structure"><a class="header" href="#class-structure">Class Structure</a></h2>
<p>Class meetings will be a mix of lectures, practice exercises, and live coding.
The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C8fSCqmkfCbtoPpi9M4ds0SZpciBmhirb-415J6XztY/edit?usp=sharing">course schedule</a> will list the topics
we're covering in a given week as well as any planned activities for a class
outside of that day's lecture. Material prepared ahead of time, such as practice
exercises and lecture outlines, will be posted online before class. Programs
coded during class will also be posted after the meeting.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy"><a class="header" href="#attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</a></h2>
<p>I don't grade you on attendance. You're free to miss class whenever you decide
it's prudent or necessary to do so, and you don't need to give me an excuse.
However, you are still responsible for all material and work that you missed.</p>
<p>If you miss a class, you should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the course schedule to see what we did that day</li>
<li>Complete any activities you missed</li>
<li>Review any new material that was covered with a classmate who attended the
meeting</li>
<li>Review any notes or other material posted after class</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are feeling sick or suspect you may have COVID, the flu, or another
contagious illness, then please stay home and focus on recovering. You're not
likely to get much out of class while you aren't feeling well, and attending
class while sick also poses a risk to everyone else. If you want to attend while
you suspect you have a contagious illness, then wear a mask.</p>
<h1 id="course-material"><a class="header" href="#course-material">Course Material</a></h1>
<p>Most material will be covered by in-class lectures. I may occasionally post
reading assignments or videos to supplement what we cover in class.</p>
<h2 id="secondary-resources"><a class="header" href="#secondary-resources">Secondary Resources</a></h2>
<p>A few free resources you may want to use for further reading or extra practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MOOC.fi</strong>: The <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en">University of Helsinki</a> allows
free access to material from many of their courses, including an
<a href="https://java-programming.mooc.fi/">introductory Java class</a>. This course
provides reading material and practice exercises that can be accessed after
you make an account.</li>
<li><strong>UMN Textbook</strong>: The University of Minnesota's
<a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/">Open Textbook Library</a> has free
textbooks, including
<a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/419">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>.</li>
<li><strong>LibreText</strong>: The website <a href="https://libretexts.org/">libretexts.org</a> has
textbooks that cover a lot of the material we'll be learning this semester.
Two that I've used in the past are:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Book%3A_Programming_Fundamentals_(Busbee_and_Braunschweig)/00%3A_Front_Matter/03%3A_Table_of_Contents">Programming and Computation Fundamentals, by Busbee and Braunschweig</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_and_Computation_Fundamentals/Computer_Science_from_the_Bottom_Up_(Wienand)">Computer Science from the Bottom Up, by Wienand</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software"><a class="header" href="#software">Software</a></h2>
<p>There are several programs you will need for this class: a bash/zsh terminal, a
text editor, and the Java 25 JDK. There are guides linked on Blackboard for
installing these programs, and we will cover them during the first week of
class.</p>
<h2 id="other-resources"><a class="header" href="#other-resources">Other Resources</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs//api/index.html">Java API</a>
is a useful reference. It may be intimidating right now, but the more you learn
about Java and programming in general, the more easily you'll be able to
navigate the API and use it to look up information.</p>
<p>If you're curious about how Java works, you may want to look at the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/">Java Specification</a>. It's a very
technical document and not likely to come up while you're coding, but I might
reference it in class and some of you may find it interesting.</p>
<p>Finally, asking good questions is one of the most useful skills you can have as
a student. In my experience, most people (myself included) don't ask questions
as often as they should, and it can be difficult to ask a question that will
quickly lead to a helpful answer. I think the blog posts below provide excellent
advice for asking and answering questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/">https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/10/21/how-to-get-useful-answers-to-your-questions/">https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/10/21/how-to-get-useful-answers-to-your-questions/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/answer-questions-well/">https://jvns.ca/blog/answer-questions-well/</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="grading"><a class="header" href="#grading">Grading</a></h1>
<p>This class uses something close to a labor-based grading system. While the idea
of labor-based grading may be unfamiliar to many students, the implementation in
this class should be easy to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual assignments are marked either complete or incomplete depending on
whether they meet a set of requirements.</li>
<li>Assignments can be revised and resubmitted multiple times up until their
deadline. An incomplete means "try again," not "you failed."</li>
<li>Your final grade is determined by the number of assignments you complete. See
the table below.</li>
</ul>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Grade</th><th>Assignments</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>A</td><td>5+</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>C</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>F</td><td>0-1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Make sure you read the <a href="./grading/deadlines.html">deadline policy</a>. This covers
more specific rules about submitting assignments. You should also take a look at
the <a href="./grading/faq.html">FAQ</a>, which covers questions I've anticipated or been
asked in the past about the grading system. Finally, there's an optional section
about <a href="./grading/labor_based_grading.html">labor-based grading</a> in case you're
curious.</p>
<h1 id="deadlines"><a class="header" href="#deadlines">Deadlines</a></h1>
<h2 id="submission-limit-and-assignment-deadlines"><a class="header" href="#submission-limit-and-assignment-deadlines">Submission Limit and Assignment Deadlines</a></h2>
<p>You have a limited number of attempts for autograded assignments, and each
attempt has a deadline. You may submit your work any number of times before that
deadline, but I when I grade the attempt I will only use your most recent
on-time submission.</p>
<p>You are allowed one attempt at each autograded assignment per week, due by 11:59
PM ET on Sunday. I may allow extra attempts later in the semester depending on
how the first couple of projects go. If I do, then I will announce the deadlines
for these attempts on Blackboard. This means you can retry an assignment at
least once per week until its deadline.</p>
<p>Assignment deadlines will be posted on Blackboard when the assignment is
announced. A deadline is your last chance to submit the assignment. You will not
be allowed to retry after the deadline.</p>
<p>Both the attempt deadlines and assignment deadlines will be strictly enforced.
This keeps them simple and consistent, and it should not be a problem unless you
wait until the last minute to turn something in.</p>
<h2 id="blackboard-submissions"><a class="header" href="#blackboard-submissions">Blackboard Submissions</a></h2>
<p>All work must be submitted on Blackboard. You must attach your source code in a
.java file named <em>exactly</em> as specified in the assignment.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-on-autograded-assignments"><a class="header" href="#feedback-on-autograded-assignments">Feedback on Autograded Assignments</a></h2>
<p>Most assignments are autograded. I will run your program through a series of
tests, and if it passes every test then it will be marked complete. If it fails
one or more tests, then it will be marked incomplete. My tests will also produce
feedback if they fail, and I will share this feedback with you when I update
assignment grades. This feedback should help you revise your program so that it
passes the test next time.</p>
<p>The tests have very specific requirements, and you should expect to fail all or
most of them on your first attempt. Plan on resubmitting your work at least two
or three times before your program passes every test. This means submitting your
first attempt several weeks before the deadline.</p>
<h2 id="extensions"><a class="header" href="#extensions">Extensions</a></h2>
<p>In rare cases (such as medical or family emergencies), I will allow an extension
to a deadline or an exception to another restriction on submitting an
assignment. You can email me to ask for a such an exception if you believe one
is appropriate in your situation. Your email should include an explanation of
why you need the extension, a new proposed deadline (or the proposed exception
to a policy), and your current progress on the assignment. Be sure to send me
your code and any other material you've created for the assignment so far.</p>
<p>I have some expectations if I am going to give an extension or make an exception
to a class policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>You've demonstrated that you read this policy by including <em>all</em> of the
information I just asked for.</li>
<li>If you're having trouble with the assignment, then you've taken steps to get
help. Usually this means seeing a tutor or going to office hours.</li>
<li>You are clearly making an effort to keep up with the class and not
procrastinating. If there is an ongoing problem affecting your work or
participation in the class and you want me to accommodate you, then you must
let me know early and keep me informed as that situation develops.</li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions and other exceptions are given on a case-by-case basis. I will try to
be as fair as possible, but this comes down to my judgement and whether you've
been proactively communicating with me.</p>
<h1 id="faq"><a class="header" href="#faq">FAQ</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>If I'm not graded on an assignment, does that mean I don't need to put any
effort into it?</strong> I still review assignments and check that tasks were
completed as directed. You should expect to be challenged and have to put in a
significant amount of work.</li>
<li><strong>Why can't I get an A+?</strong> QU's
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/academics/grading-system/">grading system</a> does not
include an A+. The highest grade you can earn in any QU class is an A.</li>
<li><strong>Why can't I get an A-, B+, B-, C+, or C-?</strong> There aren't enough assignments
to include an option for every in-between grade, and they're not necessary. An
A is the highest grade you can earn, a B is less demanding but still a good
grade, and a C represents the minimum requirements to pass this class and meet
the prerequisite for other classes.</li>
<li><strong>Is there extra credit?</strong> No.</li>
<li><strong>Can I get partial credit for an assignment?</strong> No. You must complete the
entire assignment, submit it on time, and submit it in the correct format to
receive credit for it. If you're having trouble, then please ask me or a tutor
for help.</li>
<li><strong>Are there exams?</strong> No. Graded exams, quizzes, and similar assessments don't
work with this grading system. There are no exams, not even a final exam.
However, I may give ungraded quizzes as a way for you to check your
understanding of topics we've covered.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about the grading system that aren't answered here, then
please don't hesitate to ask me about it! I want you to feel comfortable with
the grading system and understand what's required to earn the grade you want.</p>
<h1 id="labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#labor-based-grading">Labor-Based Grading</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#what-is-labor-based-grading">What is Labor-Based Grading?</a></h2>
<p>Labor-based grading and contract grading are approaches to grading that try to
emphasize the work you put into a class over the outcomes of that work. This
grading system specifies what work you need to complete to earn a particular
final grade, and these individual units of work aren't usually graded. You
receive a final grade based on how much work you complete rather than a weighted
average of grades from assignments and exams.</p>
<p>There are plenty of articles online about labor-based grading if you want to
read more about it. Here's one that was easy to find and that I think explains
the concept well: <a href="https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading">https://cep.barnard.edu/labor-based-grading</a>. This article
also links to an example grade contract. My implementation will differ, but my
goals are largely the same.</p>
<h2 id="why-labor-based-grading"><a class="header" href="#why-labor-based-grading">Why Labor-Based Grading?</a></h2>
<p>The author of the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I9hjemH4qo5nQYa89WW-3udW-oz4cYDoly25m8yaiik/edit?usp=sharing">example grade contract</a>
shown in the Bernard College webpage gives an excellent explanation of why they
prefer contract grading over traditional grades. I recommend reading that if you
want to hear more about the motivation behind instructors using labor-based
grading. It doesn't fix all of the problems with grades, but I think it at least
mitigates some of them.</p>
<h1 id="university-resources"><a class="header" href="#university-resources">University Resources</a></h1>
<p>This section covers some resources available to you at Quinnipiac University.
Please don't hesitate to ask me, your advisor, or an academic coach if you need
help finding or accessing a resource. If I'm not able to help you directly, then
I'll try to put you in touch with someone who can.</p>
<h2 id="academic-catalog"><a class="header" href="#academic-catalog">Academic Catalog</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/">Academic Catalog</a> includes the

<h2 id="learning-commons"><a class="header" href="#learning-commons">Learning Commons</a></h2>
<p>I highly recommend making use of the Learning Commons any time you need help
with work for this class. There should be several peer tutors available for
computer science and software engineering courses. The Learning Commons also
employs academic coaches who work with first-year students.</p>
<p>Below is some additional information about the Learning Commons and their
contact information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Learning Commons is a place for students to go when they want to achieve a
level of performance they can’t reach on their own. In a setting of practice
and growth, student resources are provided through Peer Educator programs, the
Office of Student Accessibility, and Academic Development &amp; Outreach
professional staff. The Learning Commons can be found at the Mount Carmel
Campus in the North wing of the Arnold Bernhard Library; and at the North
Haven Campus on the third floor of the Law School (SLE-340). Students are
encouraged to visit The Learning Commons for support with class content, to
improve study skills, to consult on academic success strategies, and for
general developmental advising needs.</p>

<h2 id="accommodations"><a class="header" href="#accommodations">Accommodations</a></h2>
<p>QU's policy on disabilities and accommodations can be found at
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/disability-policy/">https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/disability-policy/</a>.</p>
<p>This is a statement about accommodations and disabilities that the university
recommends including in all syllabi:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quinnipiac University is committed to creating a learning environment that
meets the needs of its diverse student body. If you anticipate or experience
any barriers to learning in this course, please feel welcome to discuss your
concerns with me.</p>
<p>If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, you may also
want to meet with the Office of Student Accessibility, to begin this
conversation or to request reasonable accommodations. Quinnipiac University
complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p>
<p>Please contact the Office of Student Accessibility by emailing access@qu.edu,
or by calling 203-582-7600. If you have already been approved for
accommodations through the Office of Student Accessibility, please meet with
me so we can develop an implementation plan together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, I want to add that your mental and physical health are more important
than your classes. If you're struggling with class due to mental health issues
or notice that you're developing unhealthy habits to cope with your workload,
then please talk to someone as early as possible. I'll try to work with you if
you tell me about a problem you're experiencing, and the earlier we talk the
more I can do to help you.</p>
<h1 id="academic-integrity-and-accountability-policy"><a class="header" href="#academic-integrity-and-accountability-policy">Academic Integrity and Accountability Policy</a></h1>
<p>You should be familiar with the following QU policies before reading the rest of
this page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Academic Integrity and Accountability (AIA):
<a href="https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/">https://catalog.qu.edu/university-policies/academic-integrity-policy/</a></li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (AI):
<a href="https://provost.qu.edu/artificial-intelligence/">https://provost.qu.edu/artificial-intelligence/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These policies apply to all courses at QU. This page covers details and
additional rules specific to our class.</p>
<h2 id="unauthorized-possession-of-materials"><a class="header" href="#unauthorized-possession-of-materials">Unauthorized Possession of Materials</a></h2>
<p>If you have not completed an assignment, then you must not at any point access
or possess a full or partial solution to that assignment. This includes material
shared by a classmate, posted online, or generated by an AI.</p>
<h2 id="ai-use-and-plagiarism"><a class="header" href="#ai-use-and-plagiarism">AI Use and Plagiarism</a></h2>
<p>The following are not allowed and will be reported as a violation of the AIA
policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying, paraphrasing, or otherwise basing any significant part of your work
off code you did not write. This includes AI-generated code, code found
online, and code written by a classmate.</li>
<li>Allowing someone else to do your work for you, dictate code to you, or
otherwise do most of the actual work. If your only contribution is typing,
then it's not your work.</li>
<li>Splitting work between multiple people or otherwise working together on an
assignment that doesn't explicitly allow group work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are allowed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using material I provide you. If I include code in an assignment, show you
code during class/office hours, or share code in my notes or other material,
then you're free to use it in any assignments for this class.</li>
<li>Asking other people for help, asking an AI for help, and looking up online
sources for help. However, your use of AI/other sources and the help you
receive from other people must not violate any other rules in this policy. Any
assistance should focus on helping you understand the problem you're trying to
solve and the programming concepts you need to use, not on writing your code.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the help you receive from someone, your use of AI, or your use of other
sources results in work that looks like it was plagiarized, AI-generated, or
otherwise in violation of the AIA policy, then it will be treated as an AIA
violation.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-work"><a class="header" href="#sharing-work">Sharing Work</a></h2>
<p>You're free to share or publicly post work completed for this class for any of
the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To include in a portfolio</li>
<li>To seek help or feedback from someone outside of the class</li>
<li>To seek help or feedback from a classmate who has already completed that
assignment</li>
<li>To discuss an assignment with someone outside of the class or a classmate who
has already completed that assignment</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm open to sharing for other reasons, but you should check with me first to
make sure this won't later be viewed as an AIA violation.</p>
<p>I also want to specify reasons for sharing that will always be considered an AIA
violation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting or sharing work for the purpose of facilitating an AIA violation</li>
<li>Sharing work with someone you know has not completed that assignment</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="syllabus-revisions"><a class="header" href="#syllabus-revisions">Syllabus Revisions</a></h1>
<p>If the syllabus needs to be revised, then any changes will be noted here. I will
also keep older versions of the syllabus available on Blackboard so that there
is a clear record of all changes.</p>
